# ScheduledWorker
A simple single-threaded scheduler, designed to get up and running quickly and with little fuss.

What this is for;
When you just need something basic, light weight, and can schedule tasks to kick off once or several times a day without the hassle of figuring out good, robust scheduling logic with appropriate error handling.

What this does NOT do (purposly);
* Multi-threaded scheduling (for now...)
* Complex rule-based scheduling (e.g., every Easter, end of a month, 7 times a second, etc.)
